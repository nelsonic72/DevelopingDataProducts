## Overview


This presentation was created by Eric J Nelson on August 11, 2019.  It meets the
requirements for the week 3 assignment for Developing Data Products.

This is a presentation of the mtcars dataset in an interactive plot using plotly.

## Cars - HP~mpg by # of cylinders


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(webshot)
data(mtcars)
carPlot <- plot_ly(mtcars, x=mtcars$hp, y=mtcars$mpg, mode="markers", color = mtcars$cyl, size=mtcars$wt) %>%
      layout(xaxis = list(title = "Horepower"), yaxis = list(title="Miles per Gallon"))
carPlot
```
This plot displays the mtcars dataset by plotting HP and MPH as the x and y in a scatterplot.  The color references the 3 of cyclinders for each car and the size of the circle represents the weight(1000 lbs).
